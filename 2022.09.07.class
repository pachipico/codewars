// My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!

// In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!

// Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.
// Multiply each number by itself.
// Add them all together.
// Take the square root of the result.
// Divide by two.
// Example
// predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) === 86
// Note: the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

// Some random tests might fail due to a bug in the JavaScript implementation. Simply resubmit if that happens to you
